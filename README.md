# CS-Project-7-Warmup

 To help ease you into the world of classes you'll need for Project 7, we've designed these warmup exercises. (You will not turn in any of the code you write because of these warmups.)

Did you have a Tamagotchi or Gigapet when you were young? Here's your chance to implement a very simple one. This program compiles and runs, but does not produce the output it should, because the implementations of the member functions are incomplete or incorrect. Fix them so that the program produces the desired output.

The places to make a change are denoted by TODO comments. You must make no changes whatsoever to the reportStatus, careFor, or main functions.
